Creates shortcuts to Google Latitude functionality. This includes:

* Friends List
* Check In
* Location History
* Manage Places

####History
On September 19, 2012, a Google Maps update removed the popular Latitude shortcut. The programming hooks (called Intents) still remained, just the shortcut that was removed.

This app installed a shortcut to that old functionality along with a few other shortcuts. A very basic app, but it got the job done.

The app was published to the Play Store until Google shuttered Latitude in August of 2013, at which point the app was removed.

The code has been given an MIT license and is being shared here.
