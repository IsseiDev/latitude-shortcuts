Google Latitude Shortcuts

Creates shortcuts to Google Latitude functionality. This includes:
  - Friends List
  - Check In
  - Location History
  - Manage Places

On September 19, 2012, a Google Maps update removed the popular Latitude shortcut that ran the Google Latitude Friends List. The programming hooks (called Intents) still remain, it's just the shortcut that was removed.

This app will install a shortcut to that old functionality (Latitude Friends List) along with a few other shortcuts.

The app itself is very basic with little done to make it visually nice. "Skinning" as well as code modifications and submissions are welcome and will be merged into the project and released on Google Play.

You can find this app on Google Play at
